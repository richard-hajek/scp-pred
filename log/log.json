        "reference": "Object Class: Euclid\nDescription: SCP-555 is a metal cylinder with rounded ends, 1.25 centimeters in diameter and 8 centimeters long, similar to a magnet commonly fed to cattle to prevent hardware disease. It emits a field of unknown nature which exerts an attractive force on dead or necrotic human tissue, including hair separated from the body, corpses, shed skin cells, and, in extreme cases, the epidermal layer of the skin. This field does not tend to follow the inverse-square law and does not interact with matter or electromagnetic fields in a manner consistent with any known force. The SCP itself appears to be impervious to force, showing no response to focused heating, compression, or striking.\nThe attractive force exerted by the field increases linearly with the amount of dead material in close proximity to the SCP. Past a certain point (measured at approximately 295 kilograms of necrotic material within two meters of the SCP), the progression becomes exponential, and the field's strength and radius increase rapidly. \nThe field also appears to have an effect on permanent magnets; the field strength of magnets in proximity to SCP-555 decreases over time, with the rate of decrease changing in proportion to SCP-555's field strength. \nSCP-555",

While small amounts of the substance, in all phases, are as colorless as mundane water, en masse it takes on a distinct deep red hue. \nIts most notable property, however, is the fact that SCP-009's reaction to temperature extremes is exactly opposite that of standard H,,2,,O: the subject assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C, and converts into a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100\u00b0C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam, though it still retains its red coloration when put under high pressure. \nExaminations of the atomic structure of SCP-009 have proved inconclusive.

        "answer": "scp - 175 is actually quite supple and is indestructible",
        "reference": "Object Class: Safe\nDescription: When not \u201cactive,\u201d SCP-175 resembles a yellowed piece of parchment, slightly larger than a standard piece of paper. The edges are torn, and it appears weathered and brittle. However, SCP-175 is actually quite supple and is indestructible despite its worn appearance, having resisted all attempts to remove pieces for testing.\nThe more interesting properties of SCP-175 are revealed when moved in relative proximity to a buried object. The proximity range seems to vary under unknown parameters: SCP-175 has become \u201cactive\u201d in distances from as short as 30 meters to as far as several kilometers. However, on average the distance ranges between 100 and 200 meters. \nWhen SCP-175 becomes \u201cactive,\u201d its appearance changes to become either a map, a set of directions to the buried object, or some hybrid thereof. Though the approximate size and shape of SCP-175 remain constant, its appearance may change to resemble various other paper and parchment varieties, and the writing or drawing implement and style vary as well, seemingly based on the mindset of the individual or individuals who buried the object. For a partial list of buried objects and their buriers, see Document 175-08. \nIf the buried object is dug up, or the"
